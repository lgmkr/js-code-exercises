### Description:

Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

[Subarray sum equals k @ leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

### Task:

```
Input:
nums = [1,1,1],
k = 2

Output: 2
```

Note:
The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

### Options

- Brute force (two loops to traverse)  
  Time complexity: O(N^2)  
  Space complexity: O(1)

- Using hashtable  
  Time complexity: O(n)  
  Space complexity: O(n)
